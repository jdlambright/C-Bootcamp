if statements

if (condition)
    {
        execute code
    }
    
string name = "Josh";    
    
string message;

if (name == "Josh")
    {
        message = "Hello Josh";
        string myvariable = "a";
    }
    
    
down here I can reference message but not my variable because myvariable was assigned within the if statement

Boolean Expression Syntax
Everything is processed in this order () then && then ||

condition1 = true
condition2 = false
condition3 = false

(condition1 || condition2 && condition3)
this statement is still true because condition 1 was.

((condition 1 || condition2) && condition3)
this statement is false because both conditions arent met
 

console.writeline(string);    writes the string and moves to the next line
 console.write(string);       writes teh string but does not move to the next line

two common lines to put at end are
console.writeline("press any key to exit...");
console.readkey();
