declaration syntax
string[] myArray;

initialization syntax
myArray = new string[number of items]

assignment sytax
myArray[0] = "item";

initialization and assignment
myArray = new string[] {"item", "item",....};


declaration initialization and assignment
string[] array_name = {"name1", "name2", "name3"}

multi diminsional arrays aka tables

first pick a data type and then put a comma in [] then name


int[,] studentPhoneNumbers = new int[5,2];

this will make a table of 5 rows and 2 columns




questions for coach...

are the length of arrays changeable once they have been assigned?

why would you use the syntax that looks like this?
string [] myArray = new string[]{"item",...}; when you dont actually need the new string[]

what do you do with different data types?
